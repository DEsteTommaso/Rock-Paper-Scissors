# Rock Paper Scissors Game - JavaScript Project

## Introduction

In this project, I developed a Rock Paper Scissors game using JavaScript, with all interactions taking place in the console. The aim was to build the game step by step, applying problem-solving techniques and best coding practices.

## Steps

1. **Computer Choice**: I wrote a `getComputerChoice` function to randomly return "rock", "paper", or "scissors".

2. **Human Choice**: I created a `getHumanChoice` function to capture user input via `prompt`.

3. **Score Tracking**: I declared `humanScore` and `computerScore` variables, both initialized at 0.

4. **Single Round**: I implemented a `playRound` function to determine the winner of each round and update the scores.

5. **Play Game**: I wrote a `playGame` function to run 5 rounds, using `playRound`, and declare the overall winner.
